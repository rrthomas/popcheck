.PP
Run popcheck with the -o switch first to make a textfile with all
messages, including numbers and sizes.
.PP
Edit this file and remove all lines describing mail you want to keep.
.PP
Make sure the only lines in the file are those describing the mails you
want to REMOVE. Please double-check because there is no turning-back

numbers and sizes (in the file) will be removed from the POP server.

.SH CAVEATS

to remove messages that you want to remove, but also to remove messages
that you didn't want to remove. BE CAREFUL.
