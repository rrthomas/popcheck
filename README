PopCheck 1.4

Installation
======
Copy the compiled program and the manpage to wherever you like.

Commandline options
===================
Usage: popcheck [-s server] [-P port] [-u user] [-p password] [-o filename] [-i filename]

-s and -u are the only ones that are required. Popcheck will ask you for
a password if it isn't supplied on the command line. The port defaults
to 110 (the standard for POP3).

-o and -i are for batch mode. Use with caution, because you can easily
delete all your mail using this function.

Keys when using the curses interface
====================================
UP, p       - Up one line
DOWN, n     - Down one line
PGUP, -     - Up one page
PGDN, space - Down one page
d           - Mark/Unmark message
s           - Exit and save changes
q           - Exit without saving anything


Batch mode
==========
* Run popcheck with the -o switch first to make a textfile with all
  messages, including numbers and sizes.

* Edit this file and remove all lines describing mail you want to keep.

* Make sure the only lines in the file are those describing the mails you
  want to REMOVE. Please double-check because there is no turning-back
  after you execute popcheck with the -i switch.

* Run popcheck with the -i switch. All messages matching the message
  numbers and sizes (in the file) will be removed from the POP server.

Please note that you run this program on your own risk. It's very easy
to remove messages that you want to remove, but also to remove messages
that you didn't want to remove. BE CAREFUL.
